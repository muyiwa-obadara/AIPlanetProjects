# AIPlanet - Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

In this course, EDA was taught thoroughly, and the final project inolves analyzing the famous Titanic Dataset.

By analysing the data, it was found that more children (passenger not older that 18), first class cabin passengers, and female were prioritized for surival.

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

The training-set has 891 examples and 11 input variables + the target variable (survived). We have uploaded the dataset here and can be directly accessed with Pandas read_csv().
